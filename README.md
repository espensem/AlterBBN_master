Updated AlterBBN.

Author: Espen Sem Jenssen.

ABOUT ALTERBBN:
AlterBBN is a public C program that computes the abundances of the light elements predicted by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). Different cosmological scenarios are implemented in AlterBBN, which can alter the BBN predictions. 

THE ORIGINAL VERSION:
The original AlterBBN_v1.4, made by Alexandre Arbey, may be downloaded from the website http://superiso.in2p3.fr/relic/alterbbn/. 

UPDATED VERSION:
This repository contains the updated version, developed during the work of my Master thesis at the Insitute of Theoretical Astrophysics at the University of Oslo. It has led to a slight re-structuring of the program, as well as the inclusion of generic dark matter candidates to the calculations.
